# This file sets the configuration of the 'Product' entity.

# NOTE: this demo application splits the backend configuration into several
# small files for educational purposes. In your application you can put the
# entire backend configuration in just one file.

# The configuration options are explained in detail in the bundle documentation,

        # check out the configuration of the other entities to see how concise
        # can be the configuration of your backend
